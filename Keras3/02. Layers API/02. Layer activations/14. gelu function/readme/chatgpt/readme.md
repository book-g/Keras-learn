### **Keras 3 - GELU Function**

---

### **1. What is the GELU Function?**

The GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) function is an activation function that combines properties of both the ReLU and the Gaussian distribution. It is defined as:

$$\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x)$$

where $\Phi(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, given by:

$$\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + \text{erf} \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \right] $$

Here, $\text{erf}$ is the error function. In practice, the GELU function can be approximated as:

$$ \text{GELU}(x) \approx 0.5x \left[ 1 + \tanh \left( \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \left(x + 0.044715x^3 \right) \right) \right] $$
