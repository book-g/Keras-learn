### **Keras 3 - Mish Function**

---

### **1. What is the Mish Function?**
The Mish function is an activation function defined as:

$$ \text{Mish}(x) = x \cdot \tanh(\ln(1 + e^x)) $$

where:
- $\tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent function.
- $\ln$ is the natural logarithm function.
- $e^x$ is the exponential function.

The Mish function is a smooth, non-monotonic activation function that combines properties of the Swish and Softplus functions.

### **2. Where is the Mish Function Used?**
- **Deep Learning Models**: Applied in various layers of neural networks, including convolutional and dense layers.
- **Experimental Research**: Used in experimental settings to evaluate its performance compared to other activation functions.

### **3. Why Use the Mish Function?**
- **Enhanced Performance**: Often improves the performance of deep neural networks by providing smoother gradients.
- **Non-Monotonicity**: Allows for more expressive power and can help with optimization in deep networks.

### **4. When to Use the Mish Function?**
- **Complex Models**: When working with deep and complex models where the expressiveness of activation functions is crucial.
- **Experimental Settings**: To test and compare against other activation functions for performance improvements.

### **5. Who Uses the Mish Function?**
- **Machine Learning Researchers**: For exploring new activation functions and their impact on model performance.
- **Deep Learning Practitioners**: When experimenting with advanced activation functions in complex models.
- **Data Scientists**: To evaluate whether Mish provides better performance on specific tasks compared to traditional activation functions.

### **6. How Does the Mish Function Work?**
1. **Smooth Activation**: The Mish function smoothly varies from negative to positive values, improving gradient flow and optimization.
2. **Combination of Functions**: Uses a combination of exponential, logarithmic, and hyperbolic tangent functions to achieve its effect.

### **7. Pros of the Mish Function**
- **Improved Performance**: Can enhance the performance of neural networks, especially in deep learning scenarios.

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation=mish),  # Mish activation function
    layers.Dense(1)  # Output layer (no activation for regression example)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Print the model summary
model.summary()

# Define a dummy input
dummy_input = np.random.random((1, 10))
