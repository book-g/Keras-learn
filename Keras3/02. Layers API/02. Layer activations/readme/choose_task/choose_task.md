Choosing the appropriate activation function depends on the nature of the task, the architecture of the model, and the specific requirements of the network. Here's a guide on how to select from the provided activation functions based on their support for different tasks and their general use cases:

### 1. **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**
   - **Supported Tasks**: 
     - General-purpose activation, especially in hidden layers of deep neural networks.
     - Computer vision tasks (CNNs).
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Output layers for classification or regression tasks where non-linearity is needed.
   - **Notes**: ReLU is prone to the "dying ReLU" problem, where neurons can become inactive.

### 2. **Sigmoid**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Binary classification (output layer).
     - Logistic regression.
     - Probability outputs (0 to 1).
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Hidden layers in deep networks (can cause vanishing gradient problem).
     - Multi-class classification (use Softmax instead).
   - **Notes**: Sigmoid squashes the input into the range (0, 1), which can lead to slow learning in deeper layers.

### 3. **Softmax**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Multi-class classification (output layer).
     - Probability distribution over classes.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Hidden layers or regression tasks.
   - **Notes**: Softmax is specifically designed for multi-class classification problems.

### 4. **Softplus**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Smooth approximation of ReLU.
     - Tasks requiring positive outputs.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Situations where the zero-centered output is necessary.
   - **Notes**: Softplus is a smoother alternative to ReLU but is less commonly used in practice.

### 5. **Softsign**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Alternatives to Tanh.
     - Tasks requiring bounded, smooth output.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Hidden layers in deep networks (can cause vanishing gradient problem).
   - **Notes**: Similar to Tanh but with slower saturation, less common in practice.

### 6. **Tanh**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Hidden layers where output should be centered around zero.
     - RNNs.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Output layers where non-negative outputs are required.
   - **Notes**: Tanh outputs between -1 and 1, which can help with convergence in some cases.

### 7. **SELU (Scaled Exponential Linear Unit)**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Deep networks where self-normalization is beneficial.
     - Fully connected layers.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Layers without normalization (SELU requires specific data scaling).
   - **Notes**: SELU can lead to faster convergence but requires careful data preprocessing.

### 8. **ELU (Exponential Linear Unit)**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Deep networks with faster convergence needs.
     - Avoiding dying ReLU problem.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Cases where the computation cost is a concern (ELU is more expensive than ReLU).
   - **Notes**: ELU outputs negative values, which helps in making the mean activations closer to zero.

### 9. **Exponential**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Specific mathematical models where exponential scaling is required.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - General deep learning tasks (rarely used in practice).
   - **Notes**: The exponential function increases rapidly, which may not be suitable for most neural network tasks.

### 10. **Leaky ReLU**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - General-purpose activation with a small gradient for negative inputs.
     - Avoiding dying ReLU problem.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Output layers where non-linearity is needed.
   - **Notes**: Leaky ReLU is often used when ReLU might lead to dead neurons.

### 11. **ReLU6**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Mobile and embedded device models (e.g., MobileNet).
     - Constrained range for activation outputs.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Tasks requiring large output ranges.
   - **Notes**: ReLU6 is a variant of ReLU that caps the output at 6, making it more suitable for quantized networks.

### 12. **SiLU (Swish)**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Deep learning tasks where smooth, non-linear activation is needed.
     - Attention mechanisms.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Tasks requiring non-negative outputs.
   - **Notes**: SiLU has shown to perform better than ReLU in some cases, especially in deep networks.

### 13. **Hard SiLU (Hard Swish)**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Mobile models (e.g., MobileNetV3).
     - When computational efficiency is critical.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Scenarios where smooth activation is essential.
   - **Notes**: A computationally cheaper approximation of SiLU, used in mobile networks.

### 14. **GeLU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit)**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Transformers and other attention mechanisms.
     - Deep networks requiring smooth activation functions.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Cases where computational simplicity is required.
   - **Notes**: GeLU is popular in NLP models (e.g., BERT) due to its smooth activation properties.

### 15. **Hard Sigmoid**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Mobile models with low computational resources.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Complex models where precise, smooth activation is needed.
   - **Notes**: A piecewise linear approximation of Sigmoid, often used in resource-constrained environments.

### 16. **Linear**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Regression (output layer).
     - Linear models.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Hidden layers where non-linearity is required.
   - **Notes**: Linear activation is the default (no activation), used mainly in output layers for regression tasks.

### 17. **Mish**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Deep networks requiring smooth, non-linear activations.
     - Computer vision, NLP.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - Cases where simpler activations are sufficient.
   - **Notes**: Mish is a newer activation function that has shown promise in outperforming ReLU in some tasks.

### 18. **Log Softmax**
   - **Supported Tasks**:
     - Multi-class classification with numerical stability requirements.
     - Language modeling.
   - **Not Supported**:
     - General hidden layers.
   - **Notes**: Log Softmax is often used in combination with the negative log-likelihood loss for better numerical stability in classification tasks.

### General Tips for Choosing Activation Functions:
- **Start Simple**: For most tasks, start with ReLU for hidden layers and Softmax/Sigmoid for output layers. Experiment if performance is not satisfactory.
- **Consider the Task**: Classification (Softmax, Sigmoid), Regression (Linear), Attention/NLP (GeLU, SiLU).
- **Avoid Common Pitfalls**: Vanishing gradients with Sigmoid/Tanh in deep networks; dying neurons with ReLU.
- **Experiment and Monitor**: Especially in complex models, try different activations and monitor performance metrics like loss and accuracy.

By carefully selecting the activation function based on the task and the architecture, you can significantly improve the performance and training stability of your neural network.
