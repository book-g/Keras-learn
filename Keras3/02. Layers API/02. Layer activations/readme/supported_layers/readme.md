Here's an overview of common activation functions and their support in various types of layers. This table shows which activation functions are generally supported and not supported for different layer types in neural networks.


### Explanation of Supported and Not Supported Layers:

- **ReLU:** Commonly used in various types of layers, including dense and convolutional layers. It may lead to dead neurons if not properly initialized.

- **Sigmoid:** Suitable for output layers in binary classification problems. Not ideal for hidden layers in deep networks due to vanishing gradients.

- **Softmax:** Used in output layers for multi-class classification problems. Not typically used in hidden layers.

- **Softplus:** Can be used as an alternative to ReLU in dense layers but is less common in practice.

- **Softsign:** An alternative to tanh, applicable to dense layers but less commonly used.

- **Tanh:** Historically used in dense, LSTM, and RNN layers but can suffer from vanishing gradients in deep networks.

- **SELU:** Effective in self-normalizing networks, suitable for dense layers.

- **ELU:** Good for dense and convolutional layers, smooths activation, and can improve performance compared to ReLU.

- **Exponential:** Less common, used in specific cases where exponential outputs are needed, but can be unstable.

- **Leaky ReLU:** Mitigates the dead neuron problem and is used in dense, convolutional, and RNN layers.

- **ReLU6:** A variant of ReLU used in constrained environments, such as mobile applications.

- **SiLU (Swish):** A newer activation function that can outperform ReLU in some cases, suitable for dense and convolutional layers.

- **Hard SiLU (Swish):** A computationally less expensive version of SiLU, used in dense and convolutional layers.

- **GeLU:** Common in modern architectures like BERT, used in dense and transformer layers.

- **Hard Sigmoid:** A faster approximation of sigmoid, used in dense layers but less commonly than other activation functions.

- **Linear:** Typically used in output layers for regression tasks. Not ideal for hidden layers due to poor learning dynamics.

- **Mish:** An emerging activation function showing promising results, applicable to dense and convolutional layers.

- **Log Softmax:** Used in output layers for multi-class classification with a negative log-likelihood loss. Less common in hidden layers.
