### **Keras 3 - `non_trainable_weights` Property**

---

### **1. What is the `non_trainable_weights` Property?**
The `non_trainable_weights` property in Keras 3 refers to the list of weights in a layer or model that are not updated during the training process. These weights are part of the model but are either fixed or set to be non-trainable. They can include variables like batch normalization statistics, fixed parameters, or other variables that should remain unchanged during training.

### **2. Where is the `non_trainable_weights` Property Used?**
- **Fixed Parameters in Layers**: Layers that have certain parameters set as fixed, such as the mean and variance in batch normalization layers.
- **Transfer Learning**: When you freeze layers or specific weights during training, they become non-trainable.
- **Custom Layers**: In custom layers, where certain parameters might be fixed by design.
- **Model Inspection**: To inspect or modify the non-trainable parameters of a model.

### **3. Why Use the `non_trainable_weights` Property?**
- **Parameter Freezing**: Essential for freezing certain parameters during training, especially in transfer learning.
- **Fixed Statistics**: Used in layers like batch normalization, where certain statistics (e.g., mean and variance) need to remain constant.
- **Model Customization**: Allows for the creation of models where some parameters are trainable while others are fixed.
- **Debugging and Analysis**: Useful for inspecting non-trainable parameters to ensure they align with model design.

### **4. When to Use the `non_trainable_weights` Property?**
- **Transfer Learning**: When you need to freeze layers or specific parameters during training to retain learned features.
- **Model Evaluation**: To inspect the non-trainable parameters after training, particularly in models with batch normalization or other layers with fixed statistics.
- **Custom Layer Development**: When developing layers that require certain parameters to be fixed, ensuring they are not updated during training.
- **Model Inspection**: During debugging or model analysis, to understand which parameters are non-trainable.

### **5. Who Uses the `non_trainable_weights` Property?**
- **Machine Learning Engineers**: For fine-tuning models and managing fixed parameters in complex networks.
- **Data Scientists**: When working with models that require certain layers or parameters to be non-trainable.
- **Researchers**: For developing novel architectures with a mix of trainable and non-trainable parameters.
- **Advanced Developers**: When integrating neural networks into applications that require specific parameter management.

### **6. How Does the `non_trainable_weights` Property Work?**
1. **Accessing `non_trainable_weights`**:
   - **Layer Level**: Access non-trainable weights in a specific layer using `layer.non_trainable_weights`.
   - **Model Level**: Access all non-trainable weights in a model using `model.non_trainable_weights`.

2. **Freezing Layers**:
   - **Setting `trainable` to `False`**: When a layer’s `trainable` attribute is set to `False`, its weights become part of the `non_trainable_weights` list.
  
3. **Custom Layers**:
   - **Defining Non-Trainable Variables**: In custom layers, you can define variables that are explicitly non-trainable.

### **7. Pros of the `non_trainable_weights` Property**
- **Control**: Provides control over which parameters remain fixed during training.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for models with a mix of trainable and non-trainable parameters, useful in transfer learning.
- **Fixed Statistics**: Ensures certain parameters like batch normalization statistics are not altered during training.
- **Debugging and Analysis**: Easy inspection of non-trainable parameters for debugging and model validation.

### **8. Cons of the `non_trainable_weights` Property**
- **Complexity**: Managing non-trainable weights adds complexity to model development.
- **Misconfiguration Risk**: Incorrectly handling non-trainable weights can lead to suboptimal model performance.
- **Limited Flexibility During Training**: Once set, non-trainable weights cannot be optimized, which may be restrictive in certain scenarios.
- **Performance Overhead**: Managing non-trainable weights can introduce additional overhead, especially in complex models.

### **11. Example of Using the `non_trainable_weights` Property**
- **Layer Freezing**: An example showing how to access non-trainable weights in a model where certain layers have been frozen.

### **12. Proof of Concept**
Here’s an example demonstrating how to manipulate the `non_trainable_weights` property in Keras.

### **13. Example Code for Proof**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, BatchNormalization
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Define a model with a batch normalization layer
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, input_shape=(784,), activation='relu'),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Freeze the batch normalization layer
model.layers[1].trainable = False

# Check which weights are non-trainable
for layer in model.layers:
    print(f"Layer: {layer.name}, Non-Trainable Weights: {len(layer.non_trainable_weights)}")

# Non-trainable weights in the batch normalization layer
non_trainable_weights = model.layers[1].non_trainable_weights
for weight in non_trainable_weights:
    print(f"Weight: {weight.name}, Shape: {weight.shape}")

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model (dummy data for illustration)
import numpy as np
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 784)
y_train = np.random.randint(10, size=(1000,))

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=3, batch_size=32)

# Inspect the non-trainable weights after training
for weight in non_trainable_weights:
    print(f"Post-Training Weight: {weight.name}, Value: {weight.numpy()}")
```

### **14. Application of the `non_trainable_weights` Property**
- **Transfer Learning**: Freeze specific layers in a pretrained model to retain learned features while fine-tuning other parts of the model.
- **Batch Normalization**: Ensures that batch normalization layers retain their learned statistics (mean, variance) during training, preventing updates.
- **Custom Layer Development**: Use non-trainable weights for parameters that should not change during training, such as constants or specific initialization values.

### **15. Key Terms**
- **Non-Trainable Weights**: Parameters in a model that are not updated during training.
- **Layer Freezing**: Setting certain layers to non-trainable to prevent their weights from being updated.
- **Batch Normalization**: A technique used to normalize inputs to a layer, often using non-trainable parameters like mean and variance.
- **Transfer Learning**: A technique where a pretrained model is used as a starting point for a new task, often freezing certain layers.

### **16. Summary**
The `non_trainable_weights` property in Keras 3 is a critical feature for managing parameters in a neural network that should remain fixed during training. It allows for precise control over model behavior, particularly in transfer learning and custom layer development, by ensuring that specific parameters are not updated during the training process. While offering significant flexibility and control, managing non-trainable weights requires careful handling to avoid potential misconfigurations and maintain optimal model performance. Understanding how to effectively use the `non_trainable_weights` property is essential for advanced neural network development and optimization in Keras.
