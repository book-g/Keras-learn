Certainly! Letâ€™s update the table with specific examples for each initializer to illustrate the supported and not supported tasks. This will provide clearer guidance on when to use each initializer and when to avoid it.


### Explanation of Supported and Not Supported Tasks:

- **RandomNormal:** 
  - **Supported:** General-purpose initialization for deep networks and convolutional layers.
  - **Not Supported:** May not be optimal for ReLU activations where He initialization is preferred.

- **RandomUniform:** 
  - **Supported:** General-purpose initialization for various layers.
  - **Not Supported:** Less effective in preventing vanishing/exploding gradients compared to specialized initializers.

- **TruncatedNormal:** 
  - **Supported:** Effective for general-purpose initialization and networks prone to extreme values.
  - **Not Supported:** May not be as effective for activation functions like ReLU compared to He initializers.

- **Zeros:** 
  - **Supported:** Bias initialization in any layer.
