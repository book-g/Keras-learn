### Explanation of Supported and Not Supported Layers:

- **RandomNormal:** Suitable for general-purpose initialization, applicable to dense, convolutional, and LSTM layers. It might be less optimal for ReLU activations compared to He initializers.

- **RandomUniform:** Similar to RandomNormal, itâ€™s good for general-purpose use but might be less effective in preventing vanishing or exploding gradients compared to specialized initializers.

- **TruncatedNormal:** Helps with networks prone to extreme values, effective in dense, convolutional, and RNN layers. Less effective for ReLU activations.

- **Zeros:** Best for initializing biases, but not recommended for weights in hidden layers due to potential symmetry issues.

- **Ones:** Like zeros, useful for bias initialization but problematic for weights in hidden layers.

- **GlorotNormal & GlorotUniform:** Effective for layers with tanh or sigmoid activations. Less suited for ReLU activations compared to He initializers.

- **HeNormal & HeUniform:** Optimal for layers with ReLU or its variants. Less effective for tanh or sigmoid activations.

- **Orthogonal:** Useful for RNNs and layers requiring orthogonality but not suitable for non-square weight matrices.

- **Constant:** Good for bias initialization but can cause issues when used for weights due to symmetry.

- **VarianceScaling:** Versatile for various types of layers, though less specific for certain activations compared to dedicated initializers.

- **LeCunNormal & LeCunUniform:** Ideal for layers with Leaky ReLU or SELU activations. Less effective for ReLU or sigmoid activations.

- **IdentityInitializer:** Useful for square weight matrices and residual networks but not for non-square matrices.
