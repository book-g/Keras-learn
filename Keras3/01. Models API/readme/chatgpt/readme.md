### **1. What is the Keras 3 Models API?**

The Keras 3 Models API is a core component of the Keras library that provides tools and functions for defining, configuring, compiling, and training deep learning models. The Models API offers two primary ways to build models:

- **Sequential API**: A simple, linear stack of layers.
- **Functional API**: A more flexible approach that allows for complex models, including models with multiple inputs and outputs, and models with shared layers.

### **6. How Does the Keras 3 Models API Work?**

- **Model Creation**:
  - **Sequential API**: Models are created by stacking layers sequentially.
  - **Functional API**: Models are created by defining input tensors and connecting layers using a more flexible approach.
- **Model Compilation**: The model is compiled with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained using the `fit` method on a dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance is evaluated using the `evaluate` method on test data.
- **Model Prediction**: The `predict` method is used to make predictions on new data.
- **Model Saving and Loading**: Models can be saved and loaded using `save` and `load_model`.
