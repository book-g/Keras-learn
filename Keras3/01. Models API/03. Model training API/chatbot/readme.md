### **Model Training APIs in Keras 3**

---

### **1. What are Model Training APIs?**
Model training APIs in Keras 3 are functions and methods that facilitate the process of training deep learning models. They handle tasks such as fitting the model to data, evaluating its performance, and making predictions. Key training APIs include `fit()`, `evaluate()`, and `predict()`. These methods are essential for adjusting model weights based on data, assessing model performance, and generating predictions from trained models.

### **2. Where are Model Training APIs Used?**

### **12. Proof of Concept**
Let's create a simple example that demonstrates the use of `fit()`, `evaluate()`, and `predict()` methods with a CNN on the MNIST dataset.

### **13. Example Code for Proof**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Define the Sequential model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Example dataset (MNIST)
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess the data
X_train = X_train.reshape((60000, 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255
X_test = X_test.reshape((10000, 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test loss: {loss:.4f}")
print(f"Test accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test[:5])
print("Predictions for the first 5 test images:", predictions)
```
